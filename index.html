  <section id="abstract">
    <p>
      This Charter defines the mission, scope, deliverables, and operational structure
      of the Semantic Agent Communication Community Group. The Group focuses on
      semantic structures that enable autonomous software agents to interoperate
      in a verifiable, accountable, and machine-interpretable manner. The scope
      covers identity, delegation, capability description, intent modeling,
      semantic logs, and conformance definitions necessary for interoperable
      agent-to-agent communication.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="status">
    <p>
      This document is a draft Charter under active development. Feedback is welcome
      via the Group’s GitHub Issues. The Group operates under the
      W3C Community and Business Group Process.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="goals">
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The Semantic Agent Communication Community Group aims to define the semantic
      foundations required for interoperable agent-to-agent communication. Existing
      approaches focus on transport protocols or model-specific behavior. This
      Group focuses instead on the semantic layer: identity, delegation, capability
      representation, intent modeling, execution traceability, and interoperable
      interfaces across heterogeneous agent systems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="scope">
    <h2>Scope of Work</h2>

    <p>
      The Community Group will define and maintain the formal ontology, semantic
      structures, and supporting representations that enable autonomous software
      agents to communicate in a verifiable and semantically consistent manner.
      The scope includes the following areas:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interaction Semantics</strong> —
        definitions for Intent, Delegation, Capability, ExecutionRecord,
        and related communicative constructs.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Identity and Verifiability Primitives</strong> —
        use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs),
        signatures, and attestation models that bind agent identity to trusted
        execution environments.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Narrative Model</strong> —
        an append-only semantic log structure that provides contextualized
        traceability, accountability, and interpretable agent behavior records.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Semantic Ledger Model</strong> —
        an implementation-independent logical model for ordered, immutable,
        verifiable records. No blockchain or consensus mechanism is implied.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Conformance Definitions</strong> —
        minimal normative requirements for interoperable interpretation of
        communicative acts, delegation, identity bindings, and execution records.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Ontology Artifacts</strong> —
        machine-readable RDF/OWL vocabularies, JSON-LD contexts, and SHACL shapes.
      </li>

      <li><strong>AgentIDL (WebIDL Extension)</strong> —
        a formally defined interface description language generated from the
        ontology, including a reference definition of type rules and the data
        model for a compiler.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Stateful Knowledge Representation Bridge</strong> —
        interfaces and serialization models for integrating version-controlled,
        stateful knowledge systems (e.g., graph databases, Git-style knowledge
        versioning). Stateless vector-based memory systems are out of scope.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Schema.org Extension Proposals</strong> —
        extensions that introduce agent-related concepts for broader adoption.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="out-of-scope">
    <h2>Out of Scope</h2>

    <p>The following areas are explicitly out of scope:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Transport protocols (HTTP, TCP, WebSockets, QUIC, etc.)</li>
      <li>Internal reasoning systems, LLM behavior, planning architectures</li>
      <li>Execution backends (CPU, GPU, WASM, hardware targets)</li>
      <li>Economic and payment systems</li>
      <li>Blockchain or distributed consensus mechanisms</li>
      <li>Vertical or domain-specific ontologies (medical, financial, legal, etc.)</li>
      <li>Regulatory or legal frameworks</li>
      <li>Executable agent runtimes, SDKs, or products (discussion of SDK implementation patterns to inform normative
        work is permitted)</li>
      <li>Conflict resolution mechanisms (CRDT, OT)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="deliverables">
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>

    <p>
      All deliverables will be published as Community Group Reports under the
      W3C Software and Document License. The Group may update deliverables iteratively,
      subject to the Decision Process outlined in this Charter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing in these deliverables constitutes a recommendation, requirement, or endorsement by W3C.
    </p>

  <section id="roles">
    <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>
      This section defines the roles required for the effective operation of the
      Semantic Agent Communication Community Group. Individuals may hold multiple
      roles. Role assignments may be proposed by the Chair and confirmed through
      the Group’s Decision Process.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Chair</h3>
      <p>
        The Chair ensures that the Group operates in accordance with the
        W3C Community Group Process. The Chair organizes meetings, prepares agendas,
        evaluates consensus, and initiates Calls for Consensus (CfC) when needed.
        The Chair may appoint Editors and Coordinators and may delegate operational
        responsibilities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Editors</h3>
      <p>
        Editors are responsible for maintaining the authoritative drafts of
        normative and non-normative documents produced by the Group. Editors
        implement the outcomes of the Decision Process and must ensure consistency
        across revisions.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Ontology Editor</strong> —
          Maintains RDF/OWL vocabularies, JSON-LD contexts, and SHACL shapes that
          represent the core semantic models.
        </li>

        <li><strong>AgentIDL Editor</strong> —
          Maintains the AgentIDL specification, including type rules, abstract
          syntax, and reference compiler definitions.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Conformance and Semantic Ledger Editor</strong> —
          Maintains conformance classes, execution record semantics, and identity
          binding models consistent with DID/VC ecosystems.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Editors may incorporate editorial (non-substantive) changes without a
        Call for Consensus. Substantive changes require consensus or a CfC.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Use Case & Requirements Coordinator</h3>
      <p>
        The Coordinator maintains the catalog of use cases and requirements, ensuring
        traceability between use cases and normative concepts in the specifications.
        The role does not define normative semantics.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Liaison Coordinator</h3>
      <p>
        The Liaison Coordinator manages communication with related W3C Groups,
        Community Groups, and external technical communities. Responsibilities
        include tracking cross-group alignment, preparing briefing notes, and
        coordinating Schema.org extension proposals where appropriate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Test Suite Maintainer</h3>
      <p>
        The Test Suite Maintainer develops and maintains SHACL validation suites
        and example semantic messages that illustrate correct usage of the ontology.
        This role ensures practical testability but does not define normative semantics.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Meeting Scribe</h3>
      <p>
        The Meeting Scribe records discussions, decisions, and action items and
        publishes minutes through publicly accessible channels.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Contributors</h3>
      <p>
        Contributors participate in discussions, raise issues, and submit pull
        requests. Contributors must comply with the W3C Code of Ethics and
        Professional Conduct and follow repository contribution guidelines.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Implementers</h3>
      <p>
        Implementers are organizations or individuals who adopt the Group’s
        deliverables in agent systems. Implementers provide interoperability
        feedback, report inconsistencies, and contribute example data or
        implementation notes. This role is non-governance but central to validating
        the specifications.
      </p>

  <section id="process">
    <h2>Community and Business Group Process</h2>

    <p>
      The Group operates under the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/">
        W3C Community and Business Group Process
      </a>.
      Terms in this Charter that conflict with that Process are void.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation requires agreement to the W3C
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">
        Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
      </a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="contributions">
    <h2>Contribution Mechanics</h2>

    <p>
      Substantive contributions to any normative deliverable may only be made
      by participants who have agreed to the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/">
        W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      All technical work is conducted in public GitHub repositories under the
      <code>s-agent-comm</code> organization. Contributions may be made via
      pull requests, issues, or comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      All repositories must include the standard W3C
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">
        CONTRIBUTING
      </a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">
        LICENSE
      </a>
      files.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="transparency">
    <h2>Transparency</h2>

    <p>
      All technical discussions, decisions, and documents must be publicly accessible.
      Meeting minutes or summaries must be posted either through GitHub Issues or a
      public mailing list.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="decision-process">
    <h2>Decision Process</h2>

    <p>
      The Group makes decisions by consensus. To ensure progress, the Group uses a <strong>lazy consensus</strong> model
      where silence implies assent. Proposals are made on the Group's public channels (e.g., GitHub Issues) and are
      considered accepted if no substantial objections are raised within a seven-day review period.
    </p>

    <p>
      If substantial objections are raised, the Chair will facilitate discussion to resolve the disagreement. When
      consensus remains unclear, the Chair may issue a Call for Consensus (CfC)
      allowing for further feedback. If disagreement persists, Committers may select an alternative
      that has substantial support. Individuals who disagree are encouraged to
      maintain alternative proposals or forks for further evaluation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Decisions reached during meetings must be recorded in GitHub Issues and are subject to the same seven-day review
      period for objections.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="chair-selection">
    <h2>Chair Selection</h2>

    <p>
      The Chair is chosen by Group participants. Participants may call for an
      election at any time if five participants, no two from the same organization,
      request one. Elections follow the procedures outlined in the
      W3C Community Group Process, including adherence to
      <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>
      for tie-breaking if needed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="amendments">
    <h2>Amendments to this Charter</h2>

    <p>
      The Group may propose revisions to this Charter using the Decision Process.
      Adoption of an amended Charter requires a 30-day approval vote and at least
      two-thirds support of the votes cast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Minor corrections, such as deliverable dates or editorial adjustments,
      may be made through the standard Group decision process without requiring
      a full amendment vote.
