      This note proposes <strong>AgentIDL</strong>, an implementation-independent
      interface layer for agent systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      As AI systems are increasingly deployed in production and industrial contexts
      requiring stable behavior across heterogeneous environments, AgentIDL identifies
      the need for a stable semantic boundary to support constraint, audit, and
      interoperability at the level of intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      This document is a draft produced by a W3C Community Group.
      It is not a W3C Recommendation and does not represent consensus of the W3C Membership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>

    <p>
      As agent systems proliferate, current implementations commonly collapse
      natural language interpretation, intent representation, execution structure,
      and runtime control into a single layer.
    </p>

    <p>
      This collapse impedes interoperability, auditability, and responsibility attribution.
      The absence of an explicit interface layer between intent and execution constitutes
      a structural gap in current agent architectures.
    </p>

    <p>
      AgentIDL is proposed to address this gap.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Definition of Agent</h2>

    <p>
      For the purpose of this Community Group:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>An agent is an entity whose actions are subject to constraint and audit.</strong>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This definition is intentionally minimal and does not assume autonomy,
      intelligence, interaction model, or internal reasoning structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      An entity that cannot, even in principle, be constrained or audited
      does not fall within the scope of this work.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Architectural Role of AgentIDL</h2>

    <p>
      AgentIDL defines a semantic interface boundary between what is intended
      and how it is executed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It does not prescribe reasoning strategies, execution mechanisms,
      or control-flow models.
    </p>

    <p>
      AgentIDL functions as a semantic contract that enables intent to be expressed,
      constrained, and examined independently of implementation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Alignment with WebIDL</h2>

    <p>
      AgentIDL is aligned with WebIDL at the level of architectural intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      WebIDL establishes stable interfaces between web-exposed semantics
      and heterogeneous browser engines without being defined by any single implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      AgentIDL applies the same principle to agent systems:
      interface-first design, implementation independence, and interoperability
      grounded in shared meaning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Relationship to Frameworks and Protocols</h2>

    <p>
      AgentIDL is not an agent framework and is not an agent protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frameworks and protocols operate at the level of implementation and interaction.
      AgentIDL operates at the level of intent-to-execution interface definition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compatibility with existing systems may exist, but such compatibility is
      derivative rather than definitional.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Missing Layer</h2>

    <p>
      Current agent systems typically transition directly from natural language
      or internal reasoning to framework-specific execution logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      This transition lacks an explicit, stable interface.
      AgentIDL introduces this missing layer by making intent representation,
      constraints, and auditability explicit and independent of runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
      At present, no mainstream agent implementation explicitly operates at this layer.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Interoperability and Intent Alignment</h2>

    <p>
      The primary interoperability concern addressed by AgentIDL is
      natural language intent alignment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interoperability is evaluated by preservation of intent boundaries,
      stability of meaning across execution contexts,
      and resistance to semantic drift introduced by implementation assumptions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scope and Review Principles</h2>

    <p>
      Proposals to adjust the scope of AgentIDL must be justified at the level
      of socio-technical compatibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arguments based solely on implementation convenience or framework design
      do not constitute sufficient grounds for scope modification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maintaining implementation neutrality is a prerequisite for interoperability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      AgentIDL formalizes an architectural boundary that is currently implicit and unstable.
    </p>

    <p>
      By defining a semantic interface between intent and execution, grounded in
      constrainability and auditability, AgentIDL provides a foundation for
      interoperable and governable agent systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      This note invites discussion on the role and shape of this missing layer,
      without constraining future implementations.
