    <p>
      This Liaison Note summarizes the scope, positioning, and non-normative outputs of the
      Semantic Agent Communication Community Group, with the intent to support information exchange
      with other W3C Groups and external standards communities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="sotd">
    <p>
      This document is a Community Group Note. It is non-normative and does not constitute a W3C Recommendation.
      Discussion and feedback are tracked publicly via the Group’s GitHub repositories.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="scope-purpose">
    <h2>Scope and purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Semantic Agent Communication Community Group develops semantic models and ontological structures that enable
      interoperable communication between autonomous software agents acting as delegated and accountable technical principals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scope of this work is limited to the semantic layer, including shared semantics for identity binding, capability
      description, intent expression, structured delegation, and verifiable execution records. The Group does not define
      transport protocols, execution runtimes, internal reasoning architectures, or hardware-specific mechanisms.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="relationship">
    <h2>Relationship to existing W3C work</h2>
    <p>
      The Group’s work builds upon established Web and Semantic Web foundations, including RDF, Linked Data,
      Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The Group aims to remain compatible with existing
      standards and does not seek to redefine or replace them.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="alignment">
    <h2>Areas of potential alignment</h2>
    <p>
      Potential areas for future alignment or information exchange may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Semantic representations of agent identity and delegation</li>
      <li>Capability and intent modeling across distributed systems</li>
      <li>Structured execution records and accountability concepts</li>
      <li>Interoperability considerations between agent systems and Web-based identity infrastructures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any alignment activities are exploratory and non-binding.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="outputs">
    <h2>Nature of outputs</h2>
    <p>
      Outputs of the Community Group are published as Community Group documents (Reports or Notes). These documents are
      non-normative. The purpose of these outputs is to share concepts, vocabularies, schemas, and design approaches that may
      inform future standardization efforts.
